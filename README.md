This is a simple game built in Python using the Turtle Graphics package for Python. On starting the game the program randomly decides whether the computer or the user goes first and displays it on the bottom right corner of the screen.

The AI is very simple. If it detects that the next move made by a player is going to cause a Connect 4, it will block it. Otherwise it attempts to stack on the best possible move available in either the vertical or horizontal direction.
